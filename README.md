# Shulker Peek

The world's simplest shulker box preview using entirely one single [Mixin](src/main/java/io/github/prismwork/shulkerpeek/mixin/BlockItemMixin.java) and completely vanilla features.

### What?

In case you don't know, vanilla has a nice class, `BundleTooltipData`, to handle bundle inventory displaying. As you can see, this is not bad for shulker box inventory previewing! More importantly, it's super simple to adapt this to work with shulker boxes. See the code for more info.
